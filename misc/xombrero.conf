## Xombrero config
# This file is a review of a pastebin I found here: https://pastebin.com/4FxhENjY
#
# They keybindings have been modified to be the same as the ones you could expect in firefox 
#
# Xombrero is not a supported package anymore, but it's still a good enough lightweight browser.
#
# Xombrero will automatically start with the default configuration. 
#If you want to change something you can create a ~/.xombrero.conf file and it will automatically override the default configuration.
# 
# These are all the settings I could find for xombrero.
# gleaned from the xombrero man pages, xombrero's about:set page
# and a couple of web sites
# https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/xombrero
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xombrero
#
# I strongly recommend cleaning this conf out as much as possible as xombrero reads it from
# beginning to end.  The shorter it is the more responsive xombrero will be.
# Most of these are default so if you dont change a setting it is safe to not include
# it in the conf as xombrero will handle it as one of its default settings
#
# Xombrero has 2 browser modes that it can use
# normal (the default) and whitelist, each of the modes enable whats listed below.
# if you use these modes you shouldnt include the default settings they
# enable in the conf unless you wish them to be changed.

# The binding won't work if you are writing in a page. You must press ESC to get into cmd mode again.
# The following notations can be used in the keybindings
# C-      Control
# S-      Shift
# M1-     Meta 1 (sometimes marked Alt)
# M2-     Meta 2
# M3-     Meta 3
# M4-     Meta 4 (sometimes marked Windows)
# M5-     Meta 2
# MB1     Mouse button 1
# MB2     Mouse button 2
# MB3     Mouse button 3
#
# The format of the keybinding entry is as follows:
# keybinding = (:)action,(!)keystroke(s)
# If the action starts with : it will be entered into the command prompt instead f being executed
# If <uri> is included in the keybind it will be replaced by the current tabs uri
# To override default gtk keybindings prefix your key with an exclamation mark (!),
# like this "keybinding = tabclose,!C-w"
